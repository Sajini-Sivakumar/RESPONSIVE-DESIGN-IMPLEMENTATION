For this project, I created a responsive webpage for a fictional brand called Homemade Heaven. The main goal of the design was to make sure the website works well and looks good on all screen sizes—whether someone is using a laptop, tablet, or mobile phone. I achieved this by using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and a bit of JavaScript for interactivity.

The navigation bar is placed at the top of the page. On larger screens, it shows all the menu items in a row, like “Home,” “Products,” “About,” and “Contact.” But when the website is viewed on a smaller screen, like a phone, these links don’t fit well in a straight line. So, I used a hamburger icon for mobile view. A hamburger icon is a simple three-line menu button. When clicked, it opens a side menu or dropdown where the user can see all the navigation links. This keeps the design clean and easy to use, even on smaller screens.

The next important part is the card design. I used cards to display products or items neatly. Each card includes an image, a product name and a short description. Cards are a great way to present information in small blocks that look organized. On a big screen, cards are shown side by side in rows. But on smaller devices, they automatically stack one below the other so users can scroll through them easily.

To make the page responsive, I used CSS media queries. These allow the webpage to detect the screen size and change styles accordingly. For example, if the screen width is below 768 pixels (a common size for tablets or phones), the layout will adjust: the navigation bar becomes a hamburger menu, the text size changes slightly for better readability, and the card layout switches to a single column.

I also made sure to use flexbox and grid layouts in CSS to align and space out elements properly. This helps the content stay centered and evenly spaced, whether on a wide or narrow screen.Overall, the design adapts seamlessly, ensuring accessibility and ease of use across all screen sizes.
